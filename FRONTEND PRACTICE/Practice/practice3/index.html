    <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
    <h3>byPercyByssheShelley</h3>
    <p>I meta traveller from anantique land,<br>
    Whosaid:Two vast and trunk less legs of stone <br>
    Standinthe desert. Near them, on the sand, <br>
    Halfsunk, ashatteredvisagelys, whose frown, <br>
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
    Tell that its sculptor well those passion sread <br>
    Which yet survive, stamped on these life less things, <br>
    The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed. <br>
    Andonthepedestal,these words appear: <br>
    My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, king of kings: <br>
    Lookonmyworks,yemighty,anddes pair! <br>
    Nothingbeside remains. Round the deck <br>
    Ofthatcolossals wreck,bound less and bare <br>
    Thelonelyandlevel sands stretch far away. <br>
